Welcome to Soft School!

Soft School is a platform dedicated towards the teaching of social skills (formally recognized as "Soft Skills") to the youth, in an effort to take back deficits caused by screens world-wide.
Through interactive lessons, gamified features, and AI-powered simulations, we plan to successfully teach future generations better skills such as Conflict Resolution, Teamwork, and Problem Solving.
